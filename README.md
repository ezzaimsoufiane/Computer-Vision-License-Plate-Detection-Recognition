# Computer-Vision-License-Plate-Detection-Recognition
Vehicle number plate detection &amp; recognition will be used to detect the plates, then extract the text from the image. In order to detect them i will use YOLOv3 object detection architecture based on convolution neural networks (Trying new stuff since i already woked with Tensorflow object detection API in the previous project)
